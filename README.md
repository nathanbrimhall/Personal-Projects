# Personal-Projects
These are some of my personal projects to showcase my skills and concepts that I have learned and mastered.

hangman.java is one of the first projects I completed that I was most proud of. Finished in April of 2025, it highlights the programming foundation that I have gained through my studies. Now that I am studying C++, I have a greater understanding of C++ syntax.

The various sudoku-related files are my attempt at creating both a sudoku-solver and a sudoku-maker. I haven't yet added a GUI to the sudoku game, but I plan on finishing that feature in the near future. The most up-to-date functional files are sudoku-maker2.0.py and sudoku_solver.py. This project highlight my proficiency in Python with some key fundamentals including object-oriented programming and recursion, among other things. While this was also completed relatively early on in my programing caraeer (June 2025), it marks a significant leap in my programming fundamentals. The other files relating to the sudoku are included to illustrate a better history of my progress and innovation as I continually innovated and looked for room for improvement.
