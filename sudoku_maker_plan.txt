Goals:

1: create a sudoku puzzle
    a: create 9x9 grid
    b: generate a puzzle with only a certain number of numbers given
        - check that it is a valid solution by the following checks
    c: check for valid numbers:
        - check that a number only appears once in a row
        - check that a number only appears once in a column
        - check that a number only appears once in a small 3x3 grid
        - I could do this with assert

2: create a sudoku solver
3: other ideas:
    - create modes (easy, medium, hard)
    - display the sudoku puzzle in an image rather than in the terminal
    - make it interactive
